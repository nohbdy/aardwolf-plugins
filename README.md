## Plugins

### autotrain

A plugin to quickly calculate how to spend your trains based upon provided stat priorities
as well as any maximum/minimum values you might wish to set.

This will eventually also automatically practice skills, and more

### mobkill

Replaces the 'Soandso is all roughed up and stuff from your attack. It is DEAD!' kill lines
with something a bit more readable.

Mostly a test project for eventually having a more reliable method of determining what
mob you just killed, once every ability's kill message is collected/parsed.

### navigator

A plugin specifically for the Navigator subclass

It allows you to specify what areas you want to bypass and will automatically set them
upon leveling up.

Additionally, it includes some aliases for setting beacons and navigating back to them.

### sleepfull

Small utility to limit how much time you spend asleep, by waking you up as soon as either a tick occurs
or you are full HP/MP/Moves

### keystore

Manage storage of keys within an external container (manor container / backpack on the floor) to
log off without having to re-farm keys.
